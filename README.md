# Find-Path-Visualizer
An interactive Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer built with Python and Pygame that allows users to create custom mazes and watch algorithms discover the shortest path.

# Features
Dijkstra / A* algorithms to find the shortest path
Interactive Grid: Easily draw and erase walls with a simple mouse click to create custom mazes.
Movable Start/End Points: Click to pick up and place the start (blue) and end (green) nodes anywhere on the grid.
Real-time Visualization: Watch the algorithm explore the grid (yellow) and then draw the final shortest path (pink).

# Languages
Python 3

# Install dependencies
Python
Pygame (pip install pygame)

# How to use
Changing algorithms by clicking on the left top corner button.
Draw/Erase Walls: Left-click on any gray square to create a red wall. Click on a wall again to erase it.
Move Start/End Nodes: Click on the blue (start) or green (end) node to "pick it up." Click again on an empty square to place it.
Find the Path: Press the Play (â–¶) button to run the algorithm.
Reset the Path: Press the Restart (â†º) button to clear the yellow and pink path for another run.
Start Over: Press the Reset (X) button to clear the entire board.
Increase/Decrease the size of the maze: Press the button ðŸ¡©/ðŸ¡« to adjust the size, there are 3 sizes: 10x10, 20x20, and 40x40
